**The Power of Scale for Parameter-Efficient Prompt Tuning**. Lester et al. EMNLP'21\
<https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.08691>

**Constrained Language Models Yield Few-Shot Semantic Parsers**. Shin et al. EMNLP'21\
(1) semantic parsing as paraphrasing natural sentences into a sublanguage/canonical expression that is close to natural languages (2) sublanguage-constrained decoding. Same few-shot performance but much less data.\
