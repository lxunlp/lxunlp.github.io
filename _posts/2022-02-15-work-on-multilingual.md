<http://ixa.si.ehu.eus/sites/default/files/dokumentuak/11455/aaai18.pdf>

**Loss in Translation: Learning Bilingual Word Mapping with a Retrieval Criterion**. Joulin et al. EMNLP'18\
Target on supervised BLI: integrate the inference as a retrieval problem into an end-to-end training process. Newly designed objective and optimization (a convex relaxation of new loss) is performed. SOTA supervised BLI before 2020.\

<https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N19-1162/>

**Improving Bilingual Lexicon Induction for Low Frequency Words**. Huang et al. EMNLP'20\
Target on supervised BLI: use two statistics to identify accuracy drop for low-frequency words, and address each of them: (1) diminishing margin between cosine similarity (optimize by hinge loss to increase margin of non-correct over correct) (2) exacerbated hubness (optimize by linear assignment). Writing is very clear.\
<https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.emnlp-main.100>

**Are All Good Word Vector Spaces Isomorphic?** Vulic et al. EMNLP'20\

<https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.emnlp-main.257>

**The Secret is in the Spectra: Predicting Cross-lingual Task Performance with Spectral Similarity Measures**. Dubossarsky et al. EMNLP'20\
Analysis on MWE: propose statistics of numerical analysis to measure isomorphism between MWE, which is shown to have strong correlation with performance on downstream tasks, suggesting this spectrum-based measurement is a strong predictor of cross-lingual transfer performance.\
<https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.emnlp-main.186>

**LNMAP: Departures from Isomorphic Assumption in Bilingual Lexicon Induction Through Non-Linear Mapping in Latent Space**. Mohiuddin et al. EMNLP'20\
Target on semi-supervised BLI (small seed dictionary): (1) use semi-supervised that outperforms all previous supervised or unsupervised approaches (2) similar to their 19 work, use autoencoder to mapping source and target embedding into latent space, and learn transformation/mapping on latent space instead of original embedding space (3) use non-linearity in autoencoder and mapping (non-isomorphism).\
Optimization: (1) loss on reconstruction of same word per autoencoder on a language (2) loss on mapping loss (similar to previous work) on latent space (3) back-translation loss across two languages (4) loss on reconstruction on the back-translated latent embedding across two languages.\
Findings: (1) new SOTA by a good margin (2) perform better on low-resource languages (3) non-linearity does not help much on rich-resource languages.\
Good related work.\
<https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.emnlp-main.215/>

**Semi-Supervised Bilingual Lexicon Induction with Two-way Interaction**. Zhao et al. EMNLP'20\
Target on semi-supervised BLI: a framework that uses interaction signals from both annotated and unannotated data. Outperform all previous BLI approaches. The framework can use other unsupervised methods.\
<https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.emnlp-main.238>

**Pre-tokenization of Multi-word Expressions in Cross-lingual Word Embeddings**. Otani et al. EMNLP'20\
Target on supervised BLI: focus on Multi-Word Expressions (MWE) in cross-lingual setting, which is important for downstream tasks: (1) build MWE lists of different languages using WordNet (2) pre-tokenize corpus using MWE list (3) train word-embedding with MWE per language (4) train mapping between two languages on the trained word-embedding without using MWE in dictionary (same training data as traditional BLI) (5) evaluation on MWE\
Findings: outperforms baseline (averaging tokens in MWE) on evaluation of MWE (2) no performance hurt for traditional single-word translation.\
<https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.emnlp-main.360/>

**Cross-Lingual BERT Transformation for Zero-Shot Dependency Parsing**. Wang et al. EMNLP'19\
Target on contextualized BLI; learn contextualized word embedding alignment (linear transformation) between Eng BERT and mBERT; word alignment is obtained through existing tool. Evaluation: zero-shot dependency parsing using existing biaffine Eng parser; comparable with XLM.\
<https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D19-1575/>

## Joint/Shared Embedding Space:

**XNLI: Evaluating Cross-lingual Sentence Representations**. Conneau, et al. EMNLP'18\
Joint multilingual sentence embedding w/ explicit alignment: use MWE + LSTM, and further force similar sentence embedding between parallel pairs and dissimilar for negative pairs.\
<https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D18-1269.pdf>

**Unicoder: A Universal Language Encoder by Pre-training with Multiple Cross-lingual Tasks**. Huang et al. EMNLP'19\
Joint multilingual embedding w/ explicit alignment: similar to XLM, with multi-tasks in pretraining using silver explicit alignment information. Although perform worse than XLM.\
<https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D19-1252/>

**Cross-lingual Language Model Pretraining**. Conneau and Lample. NIPS'19\
Joint multilingual embedding w/o explicit alignment: dubbed XLM, (1) shared vocabulary with BPE, sampling that alleviates bias towards high-resource languages (2) two monolingual objectives: traditional left-to-right (CLM); masked Cloze task (MLM) (3) multilingual objective: translation LM (TLM) using parallel data.\
Evaluation: XNLI, UNMT, NMT\
<https://papers.nips.cc/paper/8928-cross-lingual-language-model-pretraining.pdf>

**Unsupervised Cross-lingual Representation Learning at Scale**. Conneau et al. ACL'20\
Joint ME w/o explicit alignment: dubbed XLM-R following Conneau'19, with slight modification: (1) fix undertuned by using RoBERTa (2) more languages, larger dataset.\
Observation: (1) more model capacity helps with "the curse of multilinguality" (2) larger shared vocabulary helps with performance.\
Evaluation: XNLI, NER, QA, GLUE\
<https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.747.pdf>

**Do Explicit Alignments Robustly Improve Multilingual Encoders?** Wu and Dredze. EMNLP'20\
Joint ME w/ explicit alignment: experiment four different explicit alignment techniques during pretraining, including token-level linear alignment (direct) and contrastive alignment (relative); however, results show no improvement over implicit alignment such as XLM.\
<https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.emnlp-main.362>

**Low-Resource Sequence Labeling via Unsupervised Multilingual Contextualized Representations**. Bao et al. EMNLP'19\
Joint ME w/ explicit alignment: explicit distribution alignment on joint ME pretraining for closer joint embedding space, e.g. identical string, mean and variance, etc.\
Tagging task: joint ME as features + LSTM +CRF.\
<https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D19-1095.pdf>

**MULTILINGUAL ALIGNMENT OF CONTEXTUAL WORD REPRESENTATIONS**. Cao et al. ICLR'20\
Joint ME w/ explicit alignment: silver explicit word alignment on joint ME pretraining, which minimizes L2 distance with finetuning (not learning a transformation) and regularization to keep as much original pretraining embeding. Perform worse than XLM.\
<https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.03518>

**CROSS-LINGUAL ALIGNMENT VS JOINT TRAINING: A COMPARATIVE STUDY AND A SIMPLE UNIFIED FRAMEWORK**. Wang et al. ICLR'20\
Joint ME w/ explicit alignment: (1) compare downstream performance between  alignment-based MWE and jointly-training-based ME (2) a general framework to do both joint training and utilizing explicit alignment.\
Evaluation on BLI, NER, MT; however, only 3 lang for NER and 2 lang for MT.\
<https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.04708>

**Improving Multilingual Models with Language-Clustered Vocabularies**. Chung et al. EMNLP'20\
Joint ME w/o explicit alignment: focus on vocabulary and use regular XLM training. Argue that using overal frequencies to determine subword vocabulary is suboptimal; group languages by k-mean clustering on language similarity (one-hot representation for each language), then allocate subwords based on cluster size.\
Evaluation on QA, XNLI, NER shows improvement with good margin; the only change is the vocabulary.\
<https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.emnlp-main.367>

**CROSS-LINGUAL ABILITY OF MULTILINGUAL BERT: AN EMPIRICAL STUDY**. K et al. ICML'20\
Analysis of mBERT: using a methodology that creating Fake-English language to analyze the important factors of cross-lingual ability in mBERT (more accurately, bilingual BERT (B-BERT) in the analysis).\
Findings: (1) shared vocabulary (overlapping word-pieces) has little impact, surprisingly; B-BERT performs well even with no shared vocabulary (2) depth and total parameters are crucial for BERT's performance, while multi-head is not significant (3) character-level and word-level tokenization perform much worse than word-piece level.\
<https://openreview.net/pdf/1499e19238fd9d7ee8a9c7e7bb6f9e2c9e6a0adf.pdf>

**On the Cross-lingual Transferability of Monolingual Representations**. Artetxe et al. ACL'20\
Analysis of mBERT: (1) shared vocabulary is not necessary; disjoint vocabularies perform as well (2) an important factor is the effective vocabulary size per language (3) large numbers of languages do not perform better (also mentioned in Conneau'20) (4) joint multilingual pretraining is not essential for cross-lingual generalization; monolingual models already show generalized abstraction in layers.\
<https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.421>

**Emerging Cross-lingual Structure in Pretrained Language Models**. Conneau et al. ACL'20\
Analysis of mBERT: (1) again, shared vocabulary has trivial performance impact; still shows multilinguality with no overlapping vocabulary (2) sharing parameters is important for cross-lingual performance (3) monolingual models also show multilinguality (same finding as Artetxe'20) (4) similar to BLI, contextual word-level embedding from monolingual BERT can be aligned with simple orthogonal linear mapping (isomorphism).\
<https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.536/>

**Identifying Elements Essential for BERT’s Multilinguality**. Dufter and Schu ̈tze. EMNLP'20\
Analysis of mBERT: (1) shared position embeddings, shared special tokens, common masking strategy contribute to multilinguality (2) word order is an important factor; reversing word order disrupts multilinguality.\
Good related work on multilinguality.\
<https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.emnlp-main.358/>

**A Call for More Rigor in Unsupervised Cross-lingual Learning**. Artetxe et al. ACL'20\
Retrospect: (1) argue there are plenty parallel data in real world, hence UCL is not as necessary; still advocate UCL as important research task, as it is not obvious why UCL should be possible at all, since humans cannot align two unknown languages without any grounding (2) current UCL utilizes vocabulary more or less.\
<https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.14958.pdf>

**A Simple Approach to Learning Unsupervised Multilingual Embeddings**. Jawanpuria et al. EMNLP'20\
Joint multilingual embedding through MWE: without learning language models; approach is very simple. It provides insights on how to align two existing embeddings on a shared space.\
<https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.emnlp-main.240/>

**ERNIE-M: Enhanced Multilingual Representation by Aligning Cross-lingual Semantics with Monolingual Corpora**. Ouyang et al. EMNLP'21\
Upon XLM-R, adding two objectives for force shared alignment: (1) TLM but only using target sentences rather than both source & target (2) back-translation, by generating pseudo target sentence from source through filling MASK placeholder, then use it to predict source MASK.\
<https://aclanthology.org/2021.emnlp-main.3>

## Machine Translation

**Google’s Multilingual Neural Machine Translation System: Enabling Zero-Shot Translation**. Johnson et al. TACL'17\
Target on supervised joint multilingual MT: improve low-resource and enable zero-shot translation by using a single multilingual encoder-decoder trained with shared vocab and all multilingual parallel data consisting of multiple language pairs at once, just adding a special token in the front to indicate target language.\
Evaluation: different setup, one-to-many, many-to-one, many-to-many pairs.\
<https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/Q17-1024/>

**Massively Multilingual Neural Machine Translation**. Aharoni et al. NAACL'19\
Target on supervised joint multilingual MT: use same model as Johnson'17, scale up to 100+ languages. Evaluate many-to-many, one-to-many, many-to-one performance under different conditions (# languages involved).\
<https://aclanthology.org/N19-1388/>

**UNSUPERVISED MACHINE TRANSLATION USING MONOLINGUAL CORPORA ONLY**. Lample et al. ICLR'18\
Target on unsupervised MT: also propose unsupervised model selection.\
<https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00043>

<https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.148/>

**Bilingual Dictionary Based Neural Machine Translation without Using Parallel Sentences**. Duan et al. ACL'20\
Target on unsupervised MT: without any parallel corpus, but use a ground-truth bilingual dictionary; similar to UMT, utilizing back-translation, but replace some tokens with the corresponding token in the other language, serving as anchor points. Words are also replaced during pretraining.\
Evaluation shows that it has similar performance on rich resource lang pair with UMT, but better performance on low resource lang pair since it uses ground-truth dict.\
<https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.143/>

**Pre-training Multilingual Neural Machine Translation by Leveraging Alignment Information**. Lin et al. EMNLP'20\
Target on MT "pretraining": train MT objective on English-centric pairs with Random Aligned Substitution, randomly replacing a source word to a different language of the same meaning by using BLI. Then train on downstream language pairs.\
It performs better than directly training on downstream pairs, although this feels more like data augmentation than pretraining.\

<https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.emnlp-main.363>

**Don’t Use English Dev: On the Zero-Shot Cross-Lingual Evaluation of Contextual Embeddings**. Keung et al. EMNLP'20\
Retrospect: for tasks including MLDoc, MLQA, XNLI, etc., there exists large performance inconsistency between Eng dev and other languages' dev/test; Eng dev itself is not a good representation/evaluation for zero-shot transfer on other languages. For some languages, the directional agreement between Eng dev and other target's dev is even worse than random. See Figure 1 and Table 3.\
Suggestion: find the best checkpoint on target language's dev. (Why don't few-shot if target dev is available?..)\
