## Traditional Coref

**Sequence to Sequence Coreference Resolution**. Urbizu et al. CRAC'20\

**Incorporating Syntax and Semantics in Coreference Resolution with Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network**. Jiang and Cohn.
NAACL'21\
Construct syntactic graph by syntactic dependencies and semantic graph by SRL + GAT per graph + heterogeneous
integration.\
